   import TeamsModule
   to shouldProcess: return url.toString().startsWith('/teams');
 - show service upgrade code
 - talk about route forwarding

talk about routing organization
show ng2 route code

switch team detail to lazy-load
 - switch loadChildren to static string: 'app/team2/team_list.module'

     systemjs by default
     can implement custom loading

further talking points
 - team service is included at top-level
 - need to split up dependencies into small modules
